Resources and Development
=========================

Mailing Lists
-------------

Superlance does not have a dedicated mailing list but the main
`Supervisor-users mailing list
<http://lists.supervisord.org/mailman/listinfo/supervisor-users>`_
can be used for discussing Superlance.  This is a good place to ask questions
about installing or using Superlance.

Bug Tracker
-----------

Superlance has a bug tracker where you may report any bugs or other
errors you find.  Please report bugs to the `GitHub issues page
<https://github.com/supervisor/Superlance/issues>`_.

Version Control Repository
--------------------------

You can also view the `Superlance version control repository
<https://github.com/Supervisor/superlance>`_.

Contributing
------------

`Pull requests <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`_
can be submitted to the Superlance repository on GitHub.

In the time since Superlance was created,
there are now many `third party plugins for Supervisor <http://supervisord.org/plugins.html>`_.
Most new plugins should be in their own package rather than added to Superlance.

Author Information
------------------

The following people are responsible for creating Superlance.

Original Author
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Chris McDonough <http://plope.com>`_ is the original author of Superlance.

Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Contributors are tracked on the `GitHub contributions page
<https://github.com/Supervisor/Superlance/graphs/contributors>`_.

The list below is included for historical reasons.  It records contributors who
signed a legal agreement.  The legal agreement was
`introduced <https://github.com/Supervisor/superlance/commit/90889bef6f45edb6cb7e6dcc5c7826e718c38da7>`_
in January 2014 but later
`withdrawn <https://github.com/Supervisor/superlance/commit/e2f198d2652e3177aea8c4075a13d43f7da04b5b>`_
in April 2014.  This list is being preserved in case it is useful
later (e.g. if at some point there was a desire to donate the project
to a foundation that required such agreements).
