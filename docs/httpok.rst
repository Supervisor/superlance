:command:`httpok` Documentation
==================================

:command:`httpok` is a supervisor "event listener" which may be subscribed to
a concrete ``TICK_x`` event. When :command:`httpok` receives a ``TICK_x``
event (``TICK_60`` is recommended, indicating activity every 60 seconds),
:command:`httpk` makes an HTTP GET request to a confgured URL. If the request
fails or times out, :command:`httpok`` will restart the "hung" child
process(es). :command:`httpok` can be configured to send an email notification
when it restarts a process.

:command:`httpok` is incapable of monitoring the process status of processes
which are not :command:`supervisord` child processes.

:command:`httpok` is a "console script" installed when you install
:mod:`superlance`.  Although :command:`httpok` is an executable program, it
isn't useful as a general-purpose script:  it must be run as a
:command:`supervisor` event listener to do anything useful.

Command-Line Syntax
-------------------

.. code-block:: sh

   $ httpok [-p processname] [-a] [-g] [-t timeout] [-c status_code] \
            [-b inbody] [-m mail_address] [-s sendmail] URL

.. program:: httpok

.. cmdoption:: -p <process_name>, --program=<process_name>
   
   Restart the :command:`supervisord` child process named ``process_name``
   if it is in the ``RUNNING`` state when the URL returns an unexpected
   result or times out.

   This option can be provided more than once to have :command:`httpok`
   monitor more than one process.
   
   To monitor a process which is part of a :command:`supervisord` group,
   specify its name as ``process_name:group_name``.

.. cmdoption:: -a, --any
   
   Restart any child of :command:`supervisord` in the ``RUNNING`` state
   if the URL returns an unexpected result or times out.
    
   Overrides any ``-p`` parameters passed in the same :command:`httpok`
   process invocation.

.. cmdoption:: -g <gcore_program>, --gcore=<gcore_program>
   
   Use the specifed program to ``gcore`` the :command:`supervisord` child
   process.  The program should accept two arguments on the command line:
   a filename and a pid.  Defaults to ``/usr/bin/gcore -o``.

.. cmdoption:: -d <core_directory>, --coredir=<core_directory>
   
   If a core directory is specified, :command:`httpok` will try to use the
   ``gcore`` program (see ``-g``) to write a core file into this directory
   for each hung process before restarting it.  It will then append any gcore
   stdout output to the email message, if mail is configured (see the ``-m``
   option below).

.. cmdoption:: -t <timeout>, --timeout=<timeout>
   
   The number of seconds that :command:`httpok` should wait for a response
   to the HTTP request before timing out.
   
   If this timeout is exceeded, :command:`httpok` will attempt to restart
   child processes which are in the ``RUNNING state, and specified by
   ``-p`` or ``-a``.

   Defaults to 10 seconds.

.. cmdoption:: -c <http_status_code>, --code=<http_status_code>
   
   Specify the expected HTTP status code for the configured URL.
   
   If this status code is not the status code provided by the response,
   :command:`httpok` will attempt to restart child processes which are
   in the ``RUNNING`` state, and specified by ``-p`` or ``-a``.  
   
   Defaults to the string, "200".

.. cmdoption:: -b <body_string>, --body=<body_string>
   
   Specify a string which should be present in the body resulting
   from the GET request.
   
   If this string is not present in the response, :command:`httpok` will
   attempt to restart child processes which are in the RUNNING state,
   and specified by ``-p`` or ``-a``.
   
   The default is to ignore the body.

.. cmdoption:: -s <sendmail_command>, --sendmail_program=<sendmail_command>
   
   Specify the sendmail command to use to send email.
   
   Must be a command which accepts header and message data on stdin and
   sends mail.  Default is ``/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i``.

.. cmdoption:: -m <email_address>, --email=<email_address>
   
   Specify an email address to which notification messages are sent.
   If no email address is specified, email will not be sent.

.. cmdoption:: -e, --eager
   
   Enable "eager" monitoring:  check the URL and emit mail even if no
   monitored child process is in the ``RUNNING`` state.
   
   Enabled by default.

.. cmdoption:: -E, --not-eager
   
   Disable "eager" monitoring:  do not check the URL or emit mail if no
   monitored process is in the RUNNING state.

.. cmdoption:: <URL>
   
   The URL to which to issue a GET request.


Configuring :command:`httpok` Into the Supervisor Config
-----------------------------------------------------------

An ``[eventlistener:x]`` section must be placed in :file:`supervisord.conf`
in order for :command:`memmon` to do its work. See the "Events" chapter in the
Supervisor manual for more information about event listeners.

The following example assumes that :command:`httpok` is on your system
:envvar:`PATH`.

.. code-block:: ini

   [eventlistener:httpok]
   command=httpok.py -p program1 -p group1:program2 http://localhost:8080/tasty
   events=TICK_60
