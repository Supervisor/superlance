0.10 (2014-07-08)

- Honor timeout in httok checks even on trying the connection.
  Without it, processes that take make than 60 seconds to accept connections
  and http_ok with TICK_60 events cause a permanent restart of the process.

- ``httpok`` now sends a ``User-Agent`` header of ``httpok``.

- Removed ``setuptools`` from the ``requires`` list in ``setup.py`` because
  it caused installation issues on some systems.

----------------

- Added license.

- Fixed bug in cmd line option validator for ProcessStateEmailMonitor
  Bug report by Val Jordan

----------------

- Superlance will now refuse to install on an unsupported version of Python.

- Allow SMTP credentials to be supplied to ProcessStateEmailMonitor
  Patch by Steven Davidson.

- Added ``-n`` option to memmon that adds this name to the email
  subject to identify which memmon process restarted a process.
  Useful in case you run multiple supervisors that control
  different processes with the same name.
  Patch by Harald Friessnegger.

- ProcessStateEmailMonitor now adds Date and Message-ID headers to emails.
  Patch by Andrei Vereha.

- Added ``crashsms`` from Juan Batiz-Benet

- Converted ``crashmailbatch`` and friends from camel case to pythonic style
