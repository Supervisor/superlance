Next Release
------------

- Removed ``setuptools`` from the ``install_requires`` list in ``setup.py``
  because it caused installation issues on some systems.

- Honor timeout in httok checks even on trying the connection.
  Without it, processes that take make than 60 seconds to accept connections
  and http_ok with TICK_60 events cause a permanent restart of the process.
