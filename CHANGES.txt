  processes using external scripts, e.g. restart the program using provided
  init daemon rather than signal via supervisor.

  for process management.

1.0.2 (2016-01-25)
------------------

  e.g. make no more than N restarts in the last M minutes.

  inside webapp directories and restart the app if there's one.

1.0.0-dev (Next Release)
------------------------

- Dropped support for Python 2.5.

- Added support for Python 3.2 and 3.3.

-----------------

  and all its child processes.  Patch by Lukas Graf.

- ``httpok`` now sends a ``User-Agent`` header of ``httpok``.

- Removed ``setuptools`` from the ``requires`` list in ``setup.py`` because
  it caused installation issues on some systems.

  subject to identify which memmon process restarted a process.
